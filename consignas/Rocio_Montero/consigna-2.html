        <p>Grace Murray Hopper created the first complex computer language. Margaret Hamilton encoded the software that made it possible for man to reach the Moon. Radia Perlman is behind one of the essential discoveries for the functioning of the Internet. They are just three of the female programmers who have marked the history of technology. Like them, thousands of women around the world who write code have worked, and work daily, in a sector entirely dominated by men.</p>
        <br>
        <p><i>"Although the percentage of women has never been very high in the sectors related to computing and programming, from the 90s it worsened even more,"</i> says Marta Jiménez Castells, PhD in Computer Architecture and professor for 25 years at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia. In that decade, <i>"the number of women dedicated to computer science decreased by 50%, coinciding with the change of name that this degree from Engineering to Engineering made": "We have not recovered that decline yet,"</i> she adds.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>Currently, women only represent 11% of the total developers worldwide, according to the report Java, web, mobile and PHP salary survey by the consultancy Pearson for the 2017/2018 exercise. In Spain, the average number of women who write code stands at 9.3%, slightly below the world average and far from the figure, for example, in the United Kingdom, where women represent 54.6% of the total.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>For the teacher, the solution lies in "teaching the computer science subject from the age of 10 and not leaving it for high school or even university." The ultimate goal should be to “show that computer engineering is not an unattainable career. While women make up the majority group at university, their representation in engineering did not exceed 25% in 2018, according to the study The Challenge of STEM Vocations. “Until we hit the university, neither the boys nor the girls know how to program or how to create technology. Until then we have only used it. Little can be done at the university since the women who have reached this stage of their education have already made a decision,”she says.</p>

        <p><i>"People tend to study and work in places where we feel we belong. The fact that many women do not sometimes work in technology companies means that many of us do not perceive them as spaces in which we want to work," says Ylipoti. But when developing a product, according to her, the presence of women in the team is essential to take into account the opinion of women, who are half of the population: “Any technological product will have female clients and, for therefore, in its development phase it will enrich itself with the contributions of a female programmer or a female manager.”
